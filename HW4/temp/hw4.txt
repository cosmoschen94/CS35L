1. First I switched to a new branch called "quote"
$ git checkout v3.0 -b quote

2. Next I applied the patch
$ patch -p1 < ./quote-3.0-patch.txt

3. After learning the Emacs function, I added change log entry to file 
"ChangeLog". There were 6 files needed to be edited.
C-x 4 a

Then I typed the following to each file:
Change all ` to ', excepts ` in commentary and documentation

4. I commited the changes to the new branch "quote"
$ git add .
$ git commit -F ChangeLog

5. Next I generated a file formatted-patch.txt
$ git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

6. After I exchanged formatted-patch.txt with my partner, I checked out 
version 3.0 again into a new temp branch "partner".
$ git checkout -f v3.0
$ git checkout -b partner

7. Then I applied my partner's patch.
$ git am < ../formatted-patch.txt

8. Partner: Yilin Wang
After that I repeated the README-hacking instructions
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

9. I verified the ChangeLog entry
$ make distdir

Then a directory "diffutils-3.0.1-de3d" was added to the diffutils

Inside "diffutils-3.0.1-de3d", there is "ChangeLog" file, including the 
commit messages of 6 modified files.

10. Finally I installed the latest XQuartz to connect to the SEASnet server
 and entered ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs directory. Then using the gitk command, 
 I obtained a screenshot of my view of the mergepoint.
$ ssh -X chens@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu
$ cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
$ gitk
