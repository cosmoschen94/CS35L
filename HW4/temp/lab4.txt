1. First I installed Git by adding it PATH variable.
$ export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH

2. I git cloned Diffutils into a new directory called gitroot.
$ mkdir gitroot
$ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git

3. I entered the repo and got file git-log.txt and git-tags.txt
$ cd diffutils
$ git log > git-log.txt
$ git tag > git-tags.txt

4. I opened git-log.txt using emacs and found the hash value, copied it 
and then generated a patch for that commit.
$ emacs git-log.txt
$ M-s w maint: qu
$ git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > quote-patch.txt

5. After generating patch, I checked out Diffutils version 3.0
$ git checkout v3.0

6. Then I applied quote-patch.txt to version 3.0 and skipped past some 
files by typing RET
$ patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt

7. Got an overview of what happened, which showed changes not staged for 
commit and untracked files.
$ git status

8. After learning how to manipulate in vc-diff buffer, I looked at all 
non .c files and reverted all their changes.
In Emacs: C-x v = C-x v u
yes RET

9. Then I looked at all .c files using vc-diff buffer and reverted all 
changes except changes to character-string constants.
$ C-x v = C-u C-c C-a

I used the following to move among hunks.
$ M-n

When I was not sure whether the hunk was commentary or character-string 
constants, I used the following command to enter into the source code.
$ C-c C-c

10. I examined src/diff.c.rej and src/diff3.c.rej files and manually copied
 rejected patches into the corresponding .c files.

11. I used the following command to remove untracked files.
$ git clean -f

12. I saved a patch including all the changes I have made to v3.0 into 
quote-3.0-patch.txt
$ git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt

13. Following the instructions in README-hacking, I built the modified 
version of Diffutils.
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

14. Then I verified it does the right thing with
$ diff . -
$ diff --help

The first command outputs:
diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory

The second command outputs:
...
FILES are 'FILE1 FILE2' or 'DIR1 DIR2' or 'DIR FILE...' or 'FILE... DIR'.
...

15. I did a sanity test by comparing source code of my modified version 
with source code of Diffutils 3.0. I created two directories in the gitroot
 directory.
$ mkdir diffutils-3.0
$ mkdir diffutils-3.0-patch

Then I entered src directory and copied the source code into 
diffutils-3.0-patch.
$ cp * ../../diffutils-3.0-patch

Then I checked out v3.0 and copied the source code of Diffutils 3.0 into
 diffutils-3.0.
$ git checkout -f v3.0
$ cp * ../../diffutils-3.0

Finally, I compared two source codes and outputed into a txt file.
$ diffutils-3.0-patch/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch > 
quote-3.0-test.txt

16. At last, I compared two patches and found the difference is only string 
literals, which is innocuous.
$ diff quote-3.0-patch.txt quote-3.0-test.txt
