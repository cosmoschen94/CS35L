Lab Partner: Jiuru Shao


Lab Environment Setup:

Using Ubuntu:
$ dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
Output:
openssh-client  install

So I did the following to install server side:
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server


Server-side:
I first generated public and private keys:
$ ssh-keygen

Then I created an account for my lab partner on the server:
$ sudo useradd -d /home/lab6 -m shaojiuru
$ sudo passwd shaojiuru

Then I created .ssh directory for my partner:
$ cd /home/shaojiuru
$ sudo mkdir .ssh

Then I changed ownership and permission on .ssh directory:
$ sudo chown -R shaojiuru .ssh
$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh

I also disabled password-based authentication:
$ emacs /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Then changed PasswordAuthentication option to no.

Client-side:

First I generated public and private keys:
$ ssh-keygen

Then I copied my public key to the server for key-based authentication
$ ssh-copy-id -i chensiyu@10.85.97.173

Then added private key to authentication agent:
$ ssh-add

After that, I SSH to my lab partner's server by enabling X11 forwarding:
$ ssh -X chensiyu@10.85.97.173

Finally, I tried to run a command on the remote host to open firefox on my computer:
$firefox

And it worked!
