Answers:

1. Even though other teams had been observing all the bytes goint across the network,
it would be secure becuase the bytes are encrypted and since other teams don't have the
private key, they cannot decrypt the message digest.

(1) In this case, our data won't be secure when sent across the netword since other teams
can see what we have typed for the username and password. Therefore they can obtain the
private key to decrypt our data.

(2) In this case, it would be very insecure since other teams now have access to
the private key and can decrypt our data. 


2. The gpg --verify command can only verify document integrity but it cannot prove origin.
When person B pretend to be preson A and send a document with message digest algorithm and
B's public key to person C, person C will use B's public key to decrypt B's message digest
and compare with B's document without encryption. Then C will find out that the message is
transmitted correctly without modification. However, C will not know that it is B but not A
who sends the document. Therefore, we need a trusted third party authority(certificate authority)
to verify the identity of the sender based on their issued digital certificate which certificate
the ownership of the public key by the named subject of the certificates.
